title: MUltlog $ml_version$ & iLC $ilc_version$ User Manual
---

This manual is [available in
PDF](https://logic.at/multlog/multlog.pdf) from the MUltlog website. 

MUltlog is a system which takes as input the specification of a
finitely-valued first-order logic and produces a sequent calculus, a
tableau system, a natural deduction system, and clause formation rules
for this logic. All generated rules are optimized regarding their
branching degree. The output is in the form of a scientific paper
written in LaTeX.

iLC is an editor for Tcl/Tk, which allows to specify many-valued
logics for MUltlog in a convenient form.

Further information is available on the [project
webpage](http://www.logic.at/multlog/), where you can also find an
up-to-date copy of this manual, and example outputs.

# Requirements

You need the following to run MUltlog:

- MUltlog itself. The source code is available in the [Multlog GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/rzach/multlog).

- Some standard Prolog system, e.g. [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
  Other Prologs might work as well but have not been tested with
  recent versions of MUltlog.

The output of MUltlog is in the form of a LaTeX paper. To view it
properly, you need the typesetting system

- TeX, available from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/). For Linux, the
  [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution is particularly
  convenient to install and is most likely available via your package
  manager.

MUltlog includes a special editor, iLC, which allows to specify
many-valued logics in a convenient, windows-oriented way, instead
of typing an ASCII text in a strict syntax. To use this editor
you need the script language

- [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl.tk/) (version 7.4/4.0 or later). Many Linux
  systems include Tcl/Tk by default (check for a program named
  `wish`).

On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, for instance, you can install the requirements
using the command

    sudo apt install swi-prolog tk texlive-latex-extra

# Installation

## Obtaining MUltlog

Get the newest release of MUltlog by cloning or downloading the Git
repository from [github.com/rzach/multlog](https://github.com/rzach/multlog).

## Running the installation script

As of version 1.05, MUltlog comes with an installation script for
Linux. Before running the script:

- decide which Prolog to use. The script will look for SWI-Prolog,
  SICStus, and BinProlog in some standard locations, and suggest the
  result as a default to the user.

- decide where to put MUltlog. If run as root, the default locations
  are `/usr/local/bin` for executables, `/usr/local/lib` for library
  files, and `/usr/share/doc` for documentation. If not run as root,
  the script will install into `~/.local/bin,` `~/.local/lib`, and
  `~/.local/doc`. Note that these directories must exist; the script
  will not try to create them.

To run the installation script, change to the installation directory
`multlog` and type

    ./ml_install

The script will
- determine the location of some Unix commands
- ask the user for the Prolog to use
- ask the user for the place where to put MUltlog
- generate the deinstallation script `ml_deinstall`
- insert the correct paths in some of MUltlog's files
- copy the MUltlog files in the right places.

In case of problems see the section on
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

Note that the installation procedure puts path information directly
into some of MUltlog's files. This means that to install MUltlog
somewhere else, you need the original distribution as well as the
installation script.

## Deinstallation

Run the script

    ml_deinstall

to remove files installed by `ml_install`. The deinstallation script
is located in the same directory as the other MUltlog commands like
`lgc2tex`, `lgc2pdf`, ...  (`/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin` by
default).

# Using MUltlog

The examples below assume that MUltlog was installed into the standard
place `/usr/local/*`, and assumes that the locations of the MUltlog
scripts `lgc2tex` and `lgc2pdf` are your command path. If you use
different settings, change the examples accordingly.

## Guide for the impatient

- Move to a temporary directory, e.g.,
  ```
  mkdir tmp; cd tmp
  ```
- Get the sample logic from the `doc` directory, e.g.,
  ```
  cp /usr/share/doc/multlog/sample.lgc .
  ```
- Generate the paper in PDF format
  ```
  lgc2pdf sample
  ```
  You should now be able to open `sample.pdf` using the PDF reader of
  your choice.
  
- To edit the specification of the logic before generating
  the paper, type
  ```
  ilc &
  ```
  Select "Open" from the menu "File" and type `sample`
  as the name of the file to be loaded.

The `examples/` directory of the distribution contains other example
specification and configuration files.

## Creating the specification of a logic

You can either use your favourite text editor, or the "interactive
Logic Creator" `ilc`.

In the first case specify your many-valued logic in the syntax
described in the sample specification `/usr/share/doc/multlog/sample.lgc`
and save the result as `<name>.lgc`.

To start `ilc`, type

    ilc &

A window pops up, and you are able to edit a new logic or re-edit
an already exisiting one, and to save the result in a textual format
suitable for MUltlog. Note that you have to store the logic as
`<name>`, the extension `.lgc` being added automatically.

## Creating the paper (PDF)

To obtain the paper corresponding to your logic, type

    lgc2pdf <name>

where `<name>` is the name under which you saved your logic.
This invokes MUltlog as well as PDFLaTeX and BibTeX (or
alternatively, if `pdflatex` was not found upon installation,
LaTeX, BibTeX, `dvips` and `ps2pdf`).

If `<name>.bib` exists, it should contain a bibliography entry with
key `ml`, which will be cited as the source for the definition of the
logic.

Additionally, all files are deleted except the specification
of the logic and the PDF file.

## Creating the paper (LaTeX)

If you are interested in the LaTeX source of the paper,
use `lgc2tex` instead of `lgc2pdf`:

    lgc2tex <name>

This will invoke MUltlog, but does neither LaTeXing nor cleaning up.
It will produce two files: `<name>.tex` and `<name>.sty`. `<name>.tex`
is a template LaTeX file which loads `<name>.sty`. The latter contains
the difinitions specific to your logic.

The source will be `<name>.tex` and will require `<name>.sty` and
to be compiled. `<name>.sty` contains the definitions
produced by MUltlog.

## Creating the paper (DVI)

The command

    lgc2dvi <name>

where `<name>` is the name under which you saved your logic, will
produce a DVI file of the paper.

# Specification of a logic

The directory `/usr/share/doc/multlog` (or whatever you chose)
contains a documented example of the configuration file format (as
does the `doc` subdirectory of the source distribution itself),
`sample.lgc`.

To specify a logic, your specification (`.lgc`) file has to contain
the following:

## The name of the logic (mandatory)

Here you specify the name of the logic to be used in the PDF.

Syntax:

    logic "<logname>".

where `<logname>` is a string described by the regular expression RE1

| ([ ``!#$$%&'()*+,./0-9:;<=>?@A-Z[\]^_`a-z{|}~-``] | `""` )*

of up to 40 characters. In other words, the string may consist
of any printable ASCII character, where quotes (") have to be doubled.
`<logname>` may contain LaTeX code (e.g., for accented characters),
where `\` does *not* need to be escaped.

Example:

    logic "G\""odel".

## Truth values (mandatory)

You have to list the truth values of the logic you are defining. The
order in which they are listed will be the order used for the
presentation of truth tables. Every truth value may appear only once.

Syntax:

    truth_values { <v 1>, ..., <v n> }.

Example:

    truth_values {f,*,t}.

where each of the truth values `<v 1>`, ..., `<v n>`  ($$n \ge 2$$) is described by
the regular expression RE2

| ( [`a`-`z`][`A-Za-z0-9_`]* | [`-+*^<>=~?@#$$&`]+ | `0` | [`1-9`][`0-9`]* )

The truth values may consist of up to 10 characters. Unless you specify how they 
should be typeset in the corresponding `.cfg` file, the paper will use the names 
`<vn>` in italics in the generated PDF.

## Designated truth values (mandatory)

The designated truth values are usually those representing "true".
The particular order of the values is of no significance as indicated
by the braces. Every truth value may appear at most once.

Syntax:

    designated_truth_values { <v 1>, ..., <v n> }.

Example:

    designated_truth_values {t}.

where each of the truth values <v 1>, ..., <v n>  (n>0) is described by
the regular expression RE2 above and may consist of up to 10 characters.

The choice of designated truth values has no effect on the generated
rules. However, they make a difference to what sequent, initial
tableau, or initial clause set has to be used to give a proof of an
entailment.

## Orderings of truth values (optional)

By specifying an ordering on truth values, you can declare an operator
or quantifier as being the "inf" (greatest lower bound) or "sup"
(least upper bound) operator with respect to the ordering.

Syntax:

    ordering(<ordname>, "<ordspec>").

where `<ordname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of
up to 10 characters. `<ordspec>` is a string of up to 200 characters
satisfying RE1 above. This string is either a single chain, or a set
of chains in `{`...`}`. A chain, in turn, is a seqence of either
elements separated by `<`, where each element is either a truth value
(as defined by `truth_values`) or itself a set of chains.

In order to avoid ambiguities, spaces may be used to separate the `<` sign
from truth values (which may also contain the character `<`).

The semantics of order specifications is as follows:

  - Chains like "`a < b < c < d < e`" are interpreted as an abbreviation
    for "`a < b, b < c, c < d, d < e`".
  - Independent chains are collected in sets: "`{a < b, c < d <e, ...}`";
  - Sets and chains can be nested. E.g., "`a < {b, c < d} < e`" is the
    same as "`{a < b, a < c, c < d, b < e, d < e}`".

Let $$R$$ be the relation defined by this specification. The ordering
induced by $$R$$ is the smallest reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive
relation containing $$R$$. Note that truth values with different names are
treated as being different from each other. Hence a specification
containing `a<b` and `b<a` induces no ordering, since anti-symmetry
would imply `a`=`b`.

Example:

    ordering(linear, "f < * < t").


## Definitions of operators

Optional; but what's a logic without operators?

### Mappings

In its simplest and most general form, each operator is specified by
its name and the mapping of input to output values.  The braces
indicate that the order in which the input tuples are assigned output
values is of no significance.  The definitions should be complete:
every $$k$$-tuple has to be assigned exactly one value, where $$k>0$$
is the arity of the operator. There may be several operators with the
same `<opname>` but with different `<arity>`.

Syntax:

    operator(<opname>/<arity>, mapping { <ass 1>, ..., <ass m> }).

`<opname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of up to
10 characters. `<arity>` is a non-negative integer. `<ass 1>`, ...,
`<ass m>` are assignments of the form

    ( <v 1>, ..., <v k> ) : <v>

where `<v 1>`,...,`<v k>`, and `<v>` are truth values. Assignments must
be separated by commas. For $$k = 0$$, the mapping consists of a
single truth value.

Example:

    operator(true /0, mapping { t }).
    operator(and  /2, mapping { (t,t): t,
                                (t,*): *,
                                (t,f): f,
                                (*,t): *,
                                (*,*): *,
                                (*,f): f,
                                (f,t): f,
                                (f,*): f,
                                (f,f): f
                              }

### Tables

Binary operators can be also specified as tables.  Since the order of
truth values in the table is significant, brackets are used instead of
braces.

Syntax:

    operator(<opname>/2, table [ <v 1>, ..., <v m> ]).

`<opname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of up to
10 characters. `<v 1>`,...,`<v m>` are truth values. The number of
elements in the table, $$m$$, has to be equal to $$(n+1)^2-1$$, where $$n$$
is the number of different truth values.

Example:

    operator(and/2, table   [     t, *, f,
                              t,  t, *, f,
                              *,  *, *, f,
                              f,  f, f, f
                            ]
            ).

### Inf and sup

Operators may also be declared to be the infimum (greatest lower
bound) or supremum (least upper bound) with respect to some
user-defined ordering.

Syntax:

    operator(<opname>/<arity>, sup(<ordname>)).
    operator(<opname>/<arity>, inf(<ordname>)).

Here, `<opname>`  is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of
up to 10 characters. `<arity>` is a non-negative integer greater than
one. `<ordname>` is the name of an appropriate ordering defined by an
`ordering` statement.

"sup" stands for the least-upper-bound (= supremum) operation w.r.t.
the given ordering. The value of the operator is determined as the
least upper bound of the input truth values in the ordering. "inf"
stands for the greatest-lower-bound (= infimum) operation w.r.t. the
given ordering. The value of the operator is determined as the
greatest lower bound of the input truth values in the ordering.

The ordering has to define a unique supremum/infimum for any two
truth values.

Examples:

    operator(and  /2, inf(linear)).
    operator(or   /2, sup(linear)).

## Definitions of (distribution) quantifiers

Optional. 

### Mappings

In its simplest and most general form, each quantifier is specified by
its name and a mapping assigning a truth value to each non-empty subset
of the truth values.  The definitions should be complete:
*every* non-empty subset should be assigned exactly one value.

Syntax:

    quantifier(<quname>, mapping { <ass 1>, ..., <ass m> }).

`<quname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of up to
10 characters. `<ass 1>`,...,`<ass m>` are assignments of the form `{ <v
1>, ..., <v k> } : <v>`, where `<v 1>`,...,`<v k>`, and `<v>` are truth
values. $$k$$ has to be greater than one.

Example:

    quantifier(forall, mapping { {t}    : t,
                                 {t,*}  : *,
                                 {t,f}  : f,
                                 {t,*,f}: f,
                                 {*}    : *,
                                 {*,f}  : f,
                                 {f}    : f
                               }
              ).

### Induced quantifiers

The definition of induced quantifiers in a more comfortable and less
error-prone form.  Quantifiers can only be induced by operators which
are associative, commutative and idempotent.

Syntax:

    quantifier(<quname>, induced_by <opname>/<arity>).

`<quname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of up to
10 characters. `<opname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may
consist of up to 10 characters, and should be an operator defined as
above. `<arity>` is an integer greater than
one.

Example:

    quantifier(forall, induced_by and/2).

### Inf and sup

Quantifiers can also be induced by a lub/glb operator.

Syntax:

    quantifier(<quname>, induced_by <bop>(<ordname>)).

`<quname>` is defined according to RE2 above and may consist of up to
10 characters. `<bop>` is either sup or inf. `<ordname>` is the name of
an appropriate ordering defined by an "`ordering`"-statement.

Example:

    quantifier(forall, induced_by inf(linear)).

## interactive Logic Creator

`ilc` is a graphical front-end to make creating `.lgc` files a little
easier.  It requires Tcl/Tk (version 7.4/4.0 or later). To be exact,
you only need the executable `wish` (the windowing shell) but not the
libraries and none of the extensions.

The program should be rather self-explanatory once you know what
goes into the `.lgc` file. You can load and save `.lgc` files from the
"File" menu.  Before you can specify orderings, operators, and
quantifiers, you have to enter the name of the logic and the list of
truth values.

# TeX configuration files

MUltlog will generate a `.tex` and `.sty` file from a given `.lgc`
file. If present, it will also use the content of a corresponding
`.cfg` file, which can be used to fine-tune the formatted output.

The `.cfg` file for a logic can contain three kinds of declaration:

- `texName(<name>, <definition>)` associates the name `<name>` of a
  truth value, operator, or quantifier used in the `.lgc` file with
  LaTeX code used to typeset it. For instance, if `t` is a truth value
  in the `.lgc` file, then
  ```
  texName(t, "\\mathbf{T}").
  ```
  will result in the truth value `t` be typset as $$\mathbf{T}$$.
  (Note that `\` have to be doubled.)  If the LaTeX replacement is a
  simple command beginning with a lowercase letter, the quotation
  marks can be left off, e.g.,
  ```
  texName(and,    \\wedge  ).
  ```
- `texInfix(<op>)` and `texPrefix(<op>)` will cause formulas involving
  an operator to be set either as infix or prefix, as opposed to the
  default operator notation. Of course, `texInfix` can only be applied
  to binary operators, and `texPrefix` only to unary operators. For
  instance:
  ```
  texInfix(or).
  texPrefix(neg).
  ```
- `texExtra(<macro>, <definition>)` will insert a definition for
  `\<macro>` with body `<definition>` in the `.sty` file, which will
  be loaded in the preamble. This can be used to (re-)define any macro
  used in the LaTeX file.  For instance,
  ```
  texExtra("ShortName", "\\textbf{\\L}_3").
  ```
  will define `\ShortName` as `\textbf{\L}_3`, and this
  macro will be available in the LaTeX file. The LaTeX template file
  makes use of a number of macros which can be defined in this way:
  - `\Preamble` will be executed in the preamble just before
    `\begin{document}`. It can be used, e.g., to load packages needed
    for some of the operator symbols, or to change the document font.
  - `\ShortName` may contain code for an abbreviation or symbol for
    the logic. `\ShortName` will be called in math mode.
  - `\FullNameOfLogic` is the macro used to insert the name of the
    logic. By default it will be "`<logname>` logic". Sometimes this
    doesn't work, so, e.g., you could say:
    ```
    texExtra("FullNameOfLogic", "Halld\\'en's logic of nonsense").
    ```
  - `\Intro` will be called (if defined) after the first paragraph of
    the introduction, and can be used to print a paragraph on the
    history or motivation of the logic. This paragraph can use `\cite`
    to generate references to any entries in `<logname>.bib`.
  - `\Semantics` will be called just before the definition of the
    matrix of the logic. It can be used to print a paragraph, say,
    about the intuitive interpretation of the truth values, or how the
    truth functions of the operators are defined (say, on the basis of
    an ordering).
  - `\Link` will be added as a download link to the citation
    information at the bottom of the first page.

Using
```
texExtra("Preamble","\\ESequentstrue").
```
you can tell MUltlog to not use the compact representations of
sequents, but to explicitly list all components. This will only make
sense if the number of truth values is small.  In this case, sequents
are typeset using the macro `\esequent`. By default it is defined as
```
\newcommand{\esequent}[n]{#1 \mid ... \mid #n}
```
where $$n$$ is the number of truth values. It can be redefined using
```
texExtra("Preamble","\\ESequentstrue\\newcommand{\\esequent}[4]{##1 \\Rightarrow ##2 \\mid ##3 \\Rightarrow ##4}").
```
(Note the double `#`.)

# Interactive use

The command `multlog` will start Prolog and load the MUltlog source
files.  This makes it possible to use MUltlog interactively.  This
feature is expermiental and has not been tested extensively. In
particular, it does not yet include detailed error checks.

Interactive mode allows you to load the specification files of logics
and then perform queries and operations on these logics. To load a
logic, type, e.g.,
```
?- loadLogic('lukasiewicz.lgc',luk).
```
Here, `?-` is the Prolog prompt; you only enter the text after it. Now
the definition of ﾅ「kasiewicz logic is available using the ID `luk`.

To display the truth values and truth tables of your logic, say
```
?- showLogic(luk).
```
This will display the truth tables using the currently selected color
scheme. Color schemes are `plain`, `designated`, and `all` and can be
set using, e.g., `setColors(luk,plain)`. By default, logics have color
scheme `all` which displays different values in different colors, with
designated values reversed. This requires an up-to-date version of SWI
Prolog.  You can also output the truth tables in LaTeX format by
saying `showLogic(luk, tex)`.  This will require some definitions
included in the preamble of your LaTeX document, which can be
displayed using `showTexDefs`.

Formulas of a logic are built using the operator names in the `.lgc`
file, in operator notation.  Prolog variables are used for
propositional variables. So, e.g., $$X \to \lnot(X \lor Y)$$ would be
written as `imp(X, neg(or(X, Y)))`.  Instead of variables, you can
also put truth values of your logic, e.g., `imp(t, neg(or(*,f)))`.
To find the value of this formula:
```
?- hasValue(luk,imp(t, neg(or(*,f))),V).
```
Prolog will display `V =  (*)`, i.e., the value is `*`. If you hit
space, Prolog will try to find other solutions, and display `false.`
if not other solutions can be found. In this case, `V=*` is the only
solution.  However, if the formula contains variables, Prolog will
find all solutions. E.g.,
```
?- hasValue(luk,imp(X, neg(or(X,Y))),f).
```
will successively find all values for the variables `X` and `Y` so
that the value is `f`:
```
X = t,
Y = f ;
X = t,
Y =  (*) ;
X = Y, Y = t ;
false.
```
The value can itself be a variable. For instance to find a truth value
fixed point of $$\lnot X \lor X$$, type.
```
?- hasValue(luk, or(X, neg(X)),X).
```
This will find solutions `*` and `t`.

If you want to know if a formula is designated (or can be made
designated), use:
```
?- isDesignated(luk, or(X, neg(X))).
```
This will find the values `t` and `f`. Use `isUnDesignated` instead if
you are interested in undesignated values.

To test if a formula is a tautology, say
```
?- isTaut(luk, or(X, neg(X))).
```
This will just produce `false` since $$X \lor \lnot X$$ is not a
tautology: if $$X$$ is `*` the result is `*`, which is not designated:
```
?- isUnDesignated(luk, or(X, neg(X))).
X =  (*) 
```
To test for consequence, use
```
?- isConseq(luk, [X, imp(X,Y)], Y).
```
Here, the first argument `[X, imp(X,Y)]` is a *list* of formulas, and
since in ﾅ「kasiewicz logic, $$X, X \to Y \models Y$$, this will result
in `true`.

You can also test for equivalence of two formulas:
```
?- isEquiv(luk, or(X,Y), luk, imp(imp(X, Y), Y)).
```
Here, the first formula is evaluated according to the operations
(truth tables) of the first listed logic, and the second formula
according to the operations. In this case we use the same logic `luk`
for both.

To find formulas with various properties, do the following:
`findFmla(logic, F)` will successively find solutions `F` which are
formulas of `logic`.  The solutions will be ugly, e.g., `F = and(_100,
neg(_136))` (`_` followed by a number is Prolog's generic way of
naming variables). This can then be combined with other tests, e.g.,
to find all tautologies, say:
```
?- findFmla(luk,F), isTaut(luk, F).
```
The predicate `findTaut(luk, F)` does the same.

To find a formula equivalent to a given one, use `findEquiv`, e.g.,
```
?- findEquiv(luk, or(X,Y), luk, F).
```
will find all formulas `F` equivalent to $$X \lor Y$$. The first two are
boring---$$X \lor Y$$ itself and $$Y \lor X$$---but then it will discover
that you can express $$X \lor Y$$ using $$(X \to Y) \to Y$$ in ﾅ「kasiewicz
logic.

To find only formulas not involving $$\lor$$ here, you can define a
second version of ﾅ「kasiewicz logic without $$\lor$$:
```
?- loadLogic('lukasiewicz.lgc',luk2), delOp(luk2,or/2).
```
(`delOp(luk2,op/2)` deletes the 2-place operator `or` from `luk2`.)
Now
```
?- findEquiv(luk, or(X,Y), luk2, F).
```
will only find formulas of `luk2` (i.e., formulas not containing `or`)
that are equivalent to $$X \lor Y$$.

If you have two logics loaded or defined, you can have MUltlog define
a new logic as the direct product of the two.
```
?- makeProduct(l1,l2,new).
```
The logic `new` is has truth values that are pairs of truth values of
the logics `l1` and `l2`, with pairs where both components are
designated in `l1` and `l2` being designated in `new`, and operators
defined componentwise. This assumes that `l1` and `l2` have the same
operators defined.

To find the congruences of a logic, say
```
?- showCong(new).
```
This will look through all partitions of the designated and
undesignated values of logic `new` and test if the partition is a
congruence. If it is, it will display the partition of truth values
and the resulting truth tables, with congruent values colored
identically. Each class in the partition is a truth value in the
factor logic; truth values are congruent if they are elements of the
same class.  Equivalent truth values "behave the same" on all
operators, e.g., if $$v$$ and $$u$$ are equivalent, then $$\lnot v$$
and $$\lnot u$$ are also equivalent.  Only "strong" congruences are
found, i.e., congruences that respect the designated values (i.e.,
designated values are equivalent to other designated values, and
undesignated values to other undesignated values). (The first
congruence found is always the trivial one: every truth value is only
equivalent to itself.)

Once you have a congruence, you can define a new logic as the factor
logic of the old one by
```
?- makeFactor(logic, Part, factor).
```
where `logic` is the ID of the old logic, `Part` is the set of sets of
truth values that defines the congruence (displayed by `showCong`) and
`factor` is the ID of the new logic.

MUltlog can test if two logics are isomorphic:
```
?- isIso(Iso, log1, log2).
```
will succeed with `Iso` bound to a list of pairs of truth values of
logics `log1` and `log2` which represents an isomorphism, and fail if no
isomorphism exists.

# Troubleshooting

## Installation errors

The installation script may produce the following warnings
and errors.

- "Error: `<directory>` does not exist."

  The installation script did not find the directory for executables,
  library, or documentation (`/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`, and
  `/usr/share/doc` or `~/.local/bin`, `~/.local/lib`, `~./local/doc`
  by default). Create the directories before running the script or 
  select different directories when prompted.

  - "Error: could not find Unix command `<command>`."
  where `<command>` is one of
  ```
  basename chmod cp dirname false grep mkdir pwd rm sed true.
  ```
  The installation script and the scripts for starting MUltlog
  (`lgc2tex`, `lgc2dvi`, `lgc2pdf`, and `lgc2ilc`) need these Unix
  commands. The error message means that <command> could not be
  located, neither on the current command search path nor in the
  directories `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/sbin`, `/usr/bin`,
  `/usr/sbin`, `/bin`, or `/sbin`. Locate the directory containing
  `<command>` and put it on your command search path during
  installation.

  If your Unix system does not have `<command>` at all, submit an 
  issue on https://github.com/rzach/multlog/.

- "Warning: could not find TeX command `<command>`."
  where `<command>` is one of
  ```
  latex bibtex.
  ```
  The script `lgc2dvi` needs latex and bibtex to produce a DVI-file
  from the TeX document created by MUltlog. The warning means that
  `<command>` could not be located, neither on the current command
  search path nor in the directories

    `/usr/local/bin` `/usr/local/`sbin /usr/bin` `/usr/sbin` `/bin`
    `/sbin`

  Check whether TeX is properly installed and put the directory
  containing `<command>` on your command search path during
  installation.

- "Warning: couldn't find any PDF converters."

  The script `lgc2pdf` needs either `pdflatex` or `latex`, `dvips`
  and `ps2pdf` to produce a PDF-file from the TeX document created by
  MUltlog. The warning means that either `pdflatex` or `dvips` and `ps2pdf`
  could not be located, neither on the current command search path nor
  in the directories `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`,
  `/bin`, or `/sbin`. Check whether TeX and Ghostscript are properly installed
  and put the directory containing the PDF converter on your command
  search path during installation.

- "Warning: could not find Tcl/Tk command wish."

  The editor `ilc` needs the Tcl/Tk package, in particular the program
  `wish`. The warning means that `wish` could not be located, neither
  on the current command search path nor in the   in the directories
  `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`,
  `/bin`, or `/sbin`. Check  whether Tcl/Tk is properly installed and
  put the directory containing `wish` on your command search path
  during installation.

- "Error: `<command>` does not exist or has no execute permission."

  `<command>` (suggested by the user as Prolog interpreter) does
  not exist or cannot be executed.
 
- "Error: `<command>` does not behave like Prolog."

  `<command>` (suggested by the user as Prolog interpreter)
  exists but fails the test performed by the installation
  script. This test is a heuristic check whether `<command>`
  is indeed a Prolog system; more precisely, the output of
  ```
  echo 'f(X,not)=f(ger,Y), print(X),print(Y),halt.' | <command>
  ```
  is checked for the string "gernot". If `<command>` is a Prolog
  system but fails this test, or if it is no Prolog system but passes
  the test, submit an issue on https://github.com/rzach/multlog/.

## Runtime errors

- Warnings/errors about stack or heap overflows, like `Out of global
  stack`.

  Such messages indicate that the Prolog system needs more space for
  the computation than it is currently granted. Check out by which
  option the space can be increased with your Prolog system. For
  SWI-Prolog, the command-line option `--stack-limit=2g` will
  increase the total stack limit from 1GB on 64-bit-architectures
  (512MB on 32-bit-architectures) to 2GB. There are three ways to tell
  MUltlog to use this option.

  - *For a single run:* Add the Prolog option as a further argument on
    the command line.
    ```
    lgc2pdf sample --stack-limit=2g
    ```
  - *Permanently during installation:* Re-install MUltlog. When the
    installation script asks for the Prolog to be used, type e.g.,
    `/usr/bin/swipl --stack-limit=2g`.
  - *Permanently after installation:*
    Add the option `--stack-limit=2g` manually, by editing the
    files
    ```
    /usr/local/bin/lgc2tex
    /usr/local/bin/lgc2dvi
    /usr/local/bin/lgc2pdf
    /usr/local/lib/multlog/ilc/lgc2ilc
    ``` 
    Near their top there is a line starting with `PROLOG=`. Replace
    this line, e.g., by 
    ```
    PROLOG='/usr/bin/swipl --stack-limit=2g'
    ```
    Make sure that the files have still execute permission after
    saving.
